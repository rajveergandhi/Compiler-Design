Design decisions
	1. Weeding pass. Catches errors like unbalanced assignment, default only in switch, valid break and continue and valid return statements
	2. Corrected AST and pretty printer
	3. Implemented symbol table and type checking using flex and bison
	4. Details about symbol table creation
	5. Details about type checking
	6. Corrected indentation in pretty printing and symbol table
	7. Special function like init and main
	8. Other decisions

Correction of AST and Pretty printer
	Previous version gave segmentation faults in nested for and switch blocks. Redesigned the pretty printer and AST. 
	AST :
	Instead of one single convoluted NODE, we split the nodes according to purpose. The following are the nodes (one line description to follow) : 
	PROGRAM
	PACKAGE
	TOPLEVELDECL
	DCL
	VARDCL
	TYPEDCL
	FUNCDCL
	FUNC_SIGNATURE
	PARAM_LIST
	IDLIST
	TYPE
	STRUCT_TYPE
	BLOCK
	STATEMENTS
	STATEMENT
	ELSE_BLOCK
	SWTICH_CONDITION
	SWITCH_CASELIST
	EXPRLIST
	FOR_CONDITION
	SIMPLE
	EXPR
	OTHER_EXPR

	Pretty printing:
	Instead of having one function having multiple cases, created seperate functions for each node in AST. More intuitive as if prints like traversing the syntax tree.

Weeding
	Default statement
	Break and continue statements
	Return statement
	Blank identifiers
	Balancing short declarations

Symbol table and typechecking
	5 base types
	Defined types : resolved for simple types, not for compound types
	RT()
